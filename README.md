# MiniProject_BookStore
“Books are a man’s best friend.” We aim to make easy this process of making friends. 
As the entire world is getting digitalized, we hope to preserve the good habit of reading books, the ‘real’ ones. Our project enables people to browse, order and enjoy books from the safety and comfort of their homes. 
With a user-friendly interface, and a rich database, this application caters to the needs of all book-lovers. 

BookStoreMain is the initial class to be executed.
